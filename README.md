## Simplified Single-Cycle CPU simulator

Originally written for a class assignment, I
did not use any of the given code so this is 
a unique implementation, and I also didn't realize
the limited scope of the project, and in my haste
added some additional features such as an assembler.

This is not built for performance, but code clarity,
and pedagogy. It only supports a subset of MIPS instructions.
